      <article>
        <p>Made my <strong>second</strong> blog post on my new crappy blog. Wish I had more to say but I really don't. Kind of fun, Tim talks really fast though. I could see some people having their <span>head explode</span> by now. Don't really get this article tag though, never heard of it before. Okay, <strong>maybe</strong> I kind of get the whole article thing now that I've finished the first exercise with the style sheet stuff. Now I'm gonna see if this whole <em>emphasis</em> thing will actually put the text in <em>italics</em>. <strong>Yeah!</strong> Looks like it works.</p>
